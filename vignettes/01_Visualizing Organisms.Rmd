knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This function just takes the GPS coordinates from the dataframe and plots it in the map of the world. 
This could be useful in getting a knowlegde about the geographical distribution of the organism someone is researching on. 

To use the function, you just type 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
visualize_taxa("just_data")
```
